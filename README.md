# 📄 PHP Website – Culinary Cove [v1.0]

This is my first project using PHP. The main goal was to practice basic concepts like `include`, variables, and using PHP to generate some dynamic content.

## 🛠️ What's in the project?

- **Header and Footer** – Separated into individual files in the `inc/` folder and included with `include` for easier site structure and maintenance.
- **Navigation and Top Banner** – Also included dynamically using PHP.
- **Dynamic Images** – Some images change depending on the page or variables set in the PHP files.

## 🚀 How to run it

1. Make sure you have a local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/).
2. Place the project folder in the `htdocs` (or equivalent) directory.
3. Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost/your-folder-name/

## ✅ What I learned

- How to separate reusable parts of a website using `include`
- How to use variables in PHP
- Basics of combining HTML and PHP

## 📌 Notes

This is an early learning project. I focused on clean file organization and understanding how PHP can make a site more dynamic. More advanced features will be added as I continue learning.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Adding more interesting stuff.
